Someone gave me two functions to convert strings into integers. I converted some strings to the integers and noted them down. Can you help me converting the concatenation of those strings in the order mentioned in the file hashes.txt into integers?

The answer for this is the multiplication of output of both the functions for the concatenated string. (Wrap the number around flag{})

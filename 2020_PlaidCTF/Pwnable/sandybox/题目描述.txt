Story
Having had enough with animals, crossing, and those pesky racoons, you go back out into the strip and look for something else to suit your fancy. At the end of the line, you see a rather disappointing one. It doesn’t even stretch up to your knees. The wood around the edges is painted nicely, but the interior looks like pure sand. There are a couple of kids fooling around within the interior. They’re filling up buckets, making castles, dumping sand on each others’ heads. It looks like they’re having a grand old time.

You call out to them, “Hey! Are you guys having fun?”

They kids don’t respond to you, but freeze at your suggestion. Slowly, they turn to face you, their eyes wide. You walk forward, concerned. As you move closer, the kids start sinking into the sand. You get even more concerned, and start running towards the sandy box. How could someone put quicksand into a sandbox? You look around, frantically, if there’s anything you could throw them. Nobody seems to be paying attention to you, and you don’t have anything suitable available.

So, you decide to dive into the sandbox. You remember that keeping your body flat, as if you were floating on water, can help you not sink into quicksand. As you pass the edge of the box, the kids vanish. The last glimpse of them before you tumble, falling, shows you a wicked smile on one of their faces. You land face-down in a heap. You spit out a huge mouthful of sand, tasting the grit on your teeth. “Bleh! Ptoowie!”

Looking around your new surroundings, you’re in a tiny space with sand all around. You try to shake open your HUD, but it doesn’t work. With not much else you can do, you start digging your way out.

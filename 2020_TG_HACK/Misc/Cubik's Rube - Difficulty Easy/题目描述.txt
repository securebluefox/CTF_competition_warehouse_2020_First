I found an old toy in the ship's storage room and made a security check for our server. Now robots can't get in, hopefully!

Connect to the server:

nc cubiks.tghack.no 7001
or use a mirror closer to you:

nc us.cubiks.tghack.no 7001 (US)
nc asia.cubiks.tghack.no 7001 (Japan)
When can people learn that this is not cryptography? :)

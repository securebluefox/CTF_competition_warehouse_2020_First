Can you pwn these two binaries at the same time?

Your goal is to make them execute execve("/bin/sh", ...). Good luck!

nc parallel2.tghack.no 6006

or use a mirror closer to you:

nc us.parallel2.tghack.no 6006 (US)
nc asia.parallel2.tghack.no 6006 (Japan)


Some hints/clarifications:

if one of the processes crashes, you lose
the output is prefixed with an ID, either 0 or 1
for example: 0: hello, world!\n
if one process executes execve("/bin/sh", ...);, it will freeze and you can ignore it

One of our agents managed to install a service on MOTHER's network. We can use it to extract secrets, but she didn't tell me how! Can you figure it out?

nc extract.tghack.no 6000
or use a mirror closer to you:

nc us.extract.tghack.no 6000 (US)
nc asia.extract.tghack.no 6000 (Japan)
Tip
You'll find the flag in flag.txt.

Can you create shellcode that runs on x86 and x86_64 simultaneously? Read the flag in flag.txt. The following syscalls are allowed:

open
read
write
close
exit_group
mmap
nc parallel.tghack.no 6005

or use a mirror closer to you:

nc us.parallel.tghack.no 6005 (US)
nc asia.parallel.tghack.no 6005 (Japan)

Some clarifications:

you have to use the same number of syscalls for both architectures
they have to output the same amount of bytes
you have to use the same syscalls for both architectures

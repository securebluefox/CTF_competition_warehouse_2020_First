You've been contracted to check an IoT vault for a potential backdoor. Your goal is to figure out the sequence that unlocks the vault and use it to create the flag. Unfortunately, you were unable to acquire the hardware and only have a schematic drawn by the vault company's intern, a firmware dump and the model number of the microcontroller.

The flag has the following format:
utflag{P<PORT_LETTER><PORT_NUMBER>} , ex:
utflag{PD0,PD2}

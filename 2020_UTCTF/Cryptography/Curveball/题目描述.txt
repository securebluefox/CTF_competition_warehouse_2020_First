My friend Shamir was trying to share the flag with me and some of the other problem writers, but he wanted to make sure it didn't get intercepted in transmission, so he split it up. He said that the secrets that he shared will help us find the flag, but I can't figure it out! These are the secrets I've gathered so far:

```
(C81E728D9D4C2F636F067F89CC14862C, 31E96A93BF1A7CE1872A3CCDA6E07F86)
(ECCBC87E4B5CE2FE28308FD9F2A7BAF3, ADF6E4F1052BDE978344743CCDCF5771)
(E4DA3B7FBBCE2345D7772B0674A318D5, 0668FBCFE4098FEA0218163AC21E6531)
```

Can you figure out which flag is the right one?

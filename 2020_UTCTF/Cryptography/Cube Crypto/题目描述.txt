Mr. Anshel and Mr. Goldfeld were trying to exchange some asymmetric keys to get a shared key. They aren't very good at math, so they decided to use a Rubik's Cube instead to do the crypto. I don't think it's very secure though, I think you might be able to guess some of their keys :hmm:

```
Mr. A public key: [B' U', F B F, R' D, B D']
Mr. G public key: [R D L', D U' B, U F', L' F]

Mr. A sends: [B D' R' D R D L' D' R D B', B D' R' D D U' B D' R D B', B D' R' D U F' D' R D B', B D' R' D L' F D' R D B']
Mr. G sends: [U F' R D L' B' U' L D' R' F U', U F' R D L' F B F L D' R' F U', U F' R D L' R' D L D' R' F U', U F' R D L' B D' L D' R' F U']
```

**NOTE: The flag is the shared key that they generate, so it is NOT in `utflag{}` format**

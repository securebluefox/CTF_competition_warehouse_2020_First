This was supposed to be my weekend off, but noooo, you got me out here, draggin' your heavy ass through the burning desert, with your dreadlocks sticking out the back of my parachute. You gotta come down here with an attitude, actin' all big and bad. And what the hell is that smell? I coulda been at a barbecue, but I ain't mad.
